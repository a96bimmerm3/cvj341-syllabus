##Syllabus

###Course Description and Purpose

This course covers the basic aspects of interaction design and web development, focusing on production processes. It provides an overview of web design concepts including usability, accessibility, information architecture, basic animation, and graphic design; all discussed in the context of the web environment. This course further offers an introduction to fundamental and emerging web trends.

###Course objectives

- Understand the principles of interaction design
- Achieve goal-directed design
- Acquire HTML/CSS web site development skills
- Learn web typography
- Learn to design for multiple devices

###Course Prerequisites

*CVJ 106*, *CAD 102*, *CPR 202* or professor's permission.

In prerequisite courses, you learned principles of design using Adobe Creative Suite. Some of you may expect we are going to learn web design using Dreamweaver. This is not the case. Students caught using Dreamweaver will be penalized.

CVJ 341 is technically intensive. If you are unfamiliar with how your computer, web sites, browsers, code, etc. work, you will find yourself outside of a comfort zone. This is okay! We are here to learn these cool, empowering and in-demand skills! Instead of creating web sites by pointing and clicking, we are going to build them using language.

###Coursework

Students are responsible for two small projects, 1-2 unannounced skills demonstrations (test and/or assignment) and a final portfolio. A breakdown of requirements is as follows:

**Attendance/Class Participation (15 points)**

In-class activities may include discussion about readings, social or theoretical impact of web trends, peer evaluations and pair programing exercises among others.

**Assignment/Test: Technical Skills (15 points)**

Students will be required to demonstrate an understanding of the technical tools required in web design including, but not limited to: the command line, git, developer tools, information architecture, etc. These will be presented as an unannounced quiz and/or assignment.

**Assignment: Structure (15 points)**

Students will construct a detailed CV/resume using only HTML to demonstrate his/her grasp of well-structured, valid web documents.

**Assignment: Presentation (15 points)**

Using the document created for the structure assignment, students will style a CV/resume using CSS to demonstrate their understanding of design for the web, print, mobile devices and accessibility.

**Final Portfolio (40 points)**

Each student will be required to develop a personal web site which reflects their professional pursuits. The portfolio may include works from other classes, internships or work related to one's field of study (i.e. samples from a reporting, visual journalism, broadcast journalism course). The portfolio is cumulative; it should demonstrate your newly acquired abilities to present content interactively, as well as the technical know- how needed to do so. Each student is required to present their portfolio on the date of the course's final exam.

**Total points possible: 100.**


###Grading/Evaluation

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Grading is based on the completion of the aforementioned coursework. For each day any ￼project and/or assignment is late, points equivalent to a full letter grade will be deducted. The grading scale for this course is as follows:

| Min.Points | Grade |
|------------|-------|
| 94         | A     |
| 90         | A-    |
| 88         | B+    |
| 85         | B     |
| 80         | B-    |
| 78         | C+    |
| 75         | C     |
| 70         | C-    |
| 68         | D+    |
| 65         | D     |
| 60         | D-    |
| 59 or less | F     |


###Attendance Policy

Because the scope of web design is vast, attendance is required. There is a great deal of material to cover beyond what the required texts and practice offers. Attending lectures gives you the opportunity to work through new concepts or hang ups -- and ask questions. Lots of questions.

Remember: 20 percent of your grade involves participation. Additionally, 15 percent of your grade involves an unannounced test and assignment. If you do not attend class on the day these are given, you receive a zero. (Even if you find out what the assignment is and turn it in, if you are not marked as present, it will be graded as a zero.)

Excused absences may be extended to students who are required to conduct official University business, make a court appearance, tend to an urgent circumstance involving immediate family and celebrating religious holy days (see below). Documentation is required for an absence to be granted as excused.

Medical-related absences will be excused only with a dated note from a doctor and must be presented during the subsequent class after the student's absence.

####Religious Holy Day Policy
It is the student’s obligation to provide faculty members with notice of the dates they will be absent for religious holy days, preferably before the beginning of classes but no later than the end of the first three (3) class days. Absences due to observance of religious holy days not pre-arranged within the first three class days may be considered unexcused and there is no obligation to allow any make up work, including examinations. Missing a class ￼due to travel plans associated with a particular religious holy day does not constitute an excused absence. The University’s complete Religious Holy Day Policy can be found in the 2014-2015 Bulletin.


###Classroom Ettiquette

Students are expected to show respect for their peers and instructor. This includes arriving to class on time or excusing one's self for personal reasons in a quiet manner. Always give your full, undivided attention to anyone who is speaking in class, including your peers.

Mobile and tablet devices are to be turned OFF and put away prior to class. Use of computers are permitted only for live coding sessions. Note taking should be done with pen and paper. Why? Studies show students who take notes longhand remember more and have a better understanding of concepts. ([Source](http://vox.com/2014/6/4/5776804/note-taking-by-hand-versus-laptop)).

Students are responsible for their own note taking. Code samples will be available via GitHub. Audio and video recording of lectures is prohibited.


###University Honor Code and Plagiarism Statements

Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the [University of Miami Honor Code](http://miami.edu/sa/index.php/policies_and_procedures/student_rights_responsibilities/). The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework. Academic dishonesty of any kind, for whatever reason, will not be tolerated.

No honest student wants to be guilty of the intellectual crime of plagiarism, even unintentionally. Therefore, we provide you with these guidelines so that you don't accidentally fall into the plagiarism trap.

Plagiarism is the taking of someone else's words, work, or ideas, and passing them off as a product of your own efforts. Plagiarism may occur when a person fails to place quotation marks around someone else's exact words, directly rephrasing or paraphrasing someone else's words while still following the general form of the original, and/or failing to issue the proper citation to one's source material.

In student papers, plagiarism is often due to:

- turning in someone else's paper as one's own
- using another person's data or ideas without acknowledgment
- failing to cite a written source (printed or internet) of information that you used to collect data or ideas
- copying an author's exact words and putting them in the paper without quotation marks
- rephrasing an author's words and failing to cite the source￼￼￼￼
- copying, rephrasing, or quoting an author's exact words and citing a source other than where the material was obtained. (For example, using a secondary source which cites the original material, but citing only the primary material. This misrepresents the nature of the scholarship involved in creating the paper. If you have not read an original publication, do not cite it in your references as if you have!)
- using wording that is very similar to that of the original source, but passing it off as one's own

The last item is probably the most common problem in student writing. It is still plagiarism if the student uses an author's key phrases or sentences in a way that implies they are his/her own, even if s/he cites the source.

**DO. NOT. PLAGIARIZE.**

###Academic Dishonesty and Web Ethics

Because of the open-source nature of the web, there are times when using source code or other works may be permissible. Web developers frequently share code snippets, libraries, frameworks or artistic elements, but not everything is free for the taking. A short list of examples of inappropriate web ethics:

- linking to images, scripts, etc. not hosted on your own server
- making minor changes to the code of another site and submitting it as your own using copyrighted photos, graphics, multimedia, text, etc.
- using proprietary source code (this can get you in legal trouble!)

We will spend a class session going over the details of open-source content and the rights- and-wrongs of web design. When in doubt -- even the if it is 0.001 percent of doubt -- ask your professor (who may actually have an ethical option for you).

Any student caught copying or reproducing a web site design and/or source code will be considered **guilty of plagiarism**.

**The penalty for plagiarism or lapses in web ethics will result in a zero (0) on the assignment in question, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council.**

Finally, you are part of a school of communication, training to be media professionals. In addition to the university honor code, I ask that you follow of the standards of practice, integrity and ethical guidelines as set by our peers in the industry.

###￼Tips for success in CVJ 341

####Advice from former students

I asked former students to offer their insight on how to succeed in this course. Here are some of their suggestions:

"Start playing early on. Don't wait until your project to start experimenting." "Finish your assignments early so there is time to fix things that break."

"Try anything. Practice coding even if you have no idea what you are doing. Breaking something seems to be a great way to learn."

"Pay attention to the little details."

"Practice! Practice! Practice! There are no magical formulas. If you do the work, you will get better ... and quicker!"


####Professor's suggestions

**Keep up with the coursework.** Everything you learn in this course builds on previous lessons. If you fall behind, everything taught moving forward will be harder to grasp. Ideally, you should practice coding for 30-45 minutes a day. This will improve your comfort level with concepts that seem foreign and master aspects you feel strong in. (Of course, if you want to spend more time, no one is stopping you.)

**Experiment.** Your book provides examples and code to practice with. There are also many resources on the web to learn from as well. Be inquisitive -- What happens if I use this tag? What does this style attribute do? How do I get my page to look like X? Spend time applying your knowledge to something you are passionate about. You do not have to create a massive web site -- building single pages is a good way to learn, too. Your project might turn into something more popular than expected, and you will level-up your skills while doing it.

**Ask questions.** No question is a bad question. Not one web developer learned how to create a web site alone (except maybe Sir Tim Berners-Lee). Whether you do not understand a concept or are looking for a better way to do something, do not hesitate to ask.

**Learn to be resourceful.** Master Google. If you have a question that cannot be answered by your book, other web sites, a fellow student or :: gasp :: your professor, do not hesitate to search the web. There are thousands? millions? of sites dedicated to web tutorials and forums for users to ask/answer questions. You might even give IRC (Internet Relay Chat) a try. Get to know sites like A List Apart, Tuts+, Stack Overflow, and WebPlatform.org (among others). They are good starting points in trying to find an answer, but when they fail to deliver a solution, Google, Google, Google.

**￼Don't panic.** As you learn to code, you will make mistakes. Your pages will break. Things may not turn out as you believed they would. This is guaranteed, 100 percent. And that is okay. Failing is part of the learning process. Never let yourself get too frustrated. If you encounter a problem during your daily coding session and cannot figure out a solution, put it aside for the day. Think about the problem. Revisit it the next day. We'll spend time in class talking about ways to debug and problem solve. You will acquire a stronger skill set by working through issues. But ultimately, remember, do not panic.

**Drop by office hours.** If you are really stuck on a concept, drop by my office and we can work through the problem together. It is also extra time for you to get feedback on assignments and personal web projects. Maybe you want to explore another aspect of web design and development. I can help with that, too.

**Bonus tip: Get involved with the community.** Did you know there are several meetups in South Florida where people geek out over technology? Among the groups you can get involved with: Front-end Developers of Miami, Miami Ruby Brigade, Broward Ruby Brigade, Hacks/Hackers, Code for Miami, Code for Fort Lauderdale, Refresh Miami, South Florida Hack and Tell and Fort Lauderdale Treehouse. These offer great opportunities to learn more about developing your craft and gain assistance from people who work in the industry for a living. Perhaps the biggest benefit is networking with others who may guide you to internship and/or employment opportunities.
